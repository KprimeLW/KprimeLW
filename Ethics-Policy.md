I. Serve Our Users

Our users value LexiGenius not only because we provide automated legal document generation software, but because we hold ourselves to a higher standard in how we treat users and operate more generally. Keeping the following principles in mind will help us to maintain that high standard:

Integrity:

Our reputation as a company that our users can trust is our most valuable asset, and it is up to all of us to make sure that we continually earn that trust. All of our communications and other interactions with our users should increase their trust in us.

Usefulness:

Our products, features, and services should make LexiGenius more useful for all our users. We have many different types of users, from individuals to large businesses, but one guiding principle: "Is what we are offering useful?"

Privacy, Security, and Freedom of Expression:

Always remember that we are asking users to trust us with their personal information. Preserving that trust requires that each of us respect and protect the privacy and security of that information. Our security procedures strictly limit access to and use of users' personal information, and require that each of us take measures to protect user data from unauthorized access. Know your responsibilities under these procedures, and collect, use, and access user personal information only as authorized by our Security Policies, our Privacy Policies, and applicable data protection laws.

LexiGenius is committed to advancing privacy and freedom of expression for our users. Where user privacy and freedom of expression face challenges, we seek to implement internationally recognized standards that respect those rights as we develop products and do business in diverse markets. Contact the Ethics & Compliance Officer if you have questions about implementing these standards in connection with what you do at LexiGenius.

Responsiveness:

Part of being useful and honest is being responsive: We recognize relevant user feedback when we see it, and we do something about it. We take pride in responding to communications from our users, whether questions, problems, or compliments. If something is broken, fix it.

Take Action:

If you feel our users aren't being well-served, don't be bashful - let someone in the company know about it. Continually improving our products and services takes all of us, and we're proud that employees of LexiGenius champion our users and take the initiative to step forward when the interests of our users are at stake.
