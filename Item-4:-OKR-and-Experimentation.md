# Experimentation:

Creating a prototype can be a crucial step in testing and refining the product before investing significant resources in development. Here are some ways that we could create a cheap prototype:

* Use wireframing tools: Wireframing tools like Figma, Sketch, or Balsamiq can help create a visual representation of the product's layout and functionality without any coding.

* Create a video demo: Create a video that demonstrates how the product would work and its key features. This can be done using basic video editing tools like iMovie or Adobe Premiere Pro.

* Build a landing page: A landing page with a brief description of the product and a signup form can help gauge interest and collect email addresses of potential customers.

* Use paper or cardboard mockups: Draw the interface on paper or cardboard and use cutouts to show how the product would work. This can be a fun and interactive way to test the product's usability.

* Use low-code platforms: Low-code platforms like Bubble, Glide, or AppSheet allow you to create functional prototypes without extensive coding knowledge.

By creating a cheap prototype, LexiGenius can test and iterate on its product before investing significant resources in development, which can save time and money in the long run.

## **Experiment 1:** A/B tests different pricing models for our software.

**Hypothesis:** By testing different pricing models, we can optimize our pricing strategy to increase revenue and customer retention.

**Methodology:**

*  Identify at least two different pricing models that we would like to test. For example, we could test a per-document pricing model versus a 
   subscription pricing model.

*  Randomly assign a group of customers to each pricing model.

*  Measure the conversion rate, revenue per customer, and customer retention rate for each pricing model.

*  Analyze the results and determine which pricing model performs best.

**Potential outcomes:**

*  The subscription model may lead to higher customer retention rates and predictable revenue streams.

*  The per-document model may lead to higher revenue per customer but may be less predictable.

*  Depending on the results, we may decide to implement a hybrid pricing model that combines the best elements of each pricing model.

By experimenting with different pricing models, we can gain insights into what works best for our product and our target customers. This can help us optimize our pricing strategy and ultimately increase our revenue and customer retention rates.

## **Experiment 2:** Test different marketing channels to see which ones are most effective in driving traffic and conversions to your website.

**Hypothesis:** By testing different marketing channels, we can identify the most effective ways to reach our target audience and drive traffic and conversions to our website.

**Methodology:**

*  Identify at least three different marketing channels that you would like to test. For example, you could test paid advertising on social media 
   platforms, search engine optimization (SEO), and content marketing.

*  Allocate a set budget to each marketing channel.

*  Create and launch campaigns for each marketing channel.

*  Measure the amount of traffic and conversions generated by each campaign.

*  Analyze the results and determine which marketing channels are most effective in driving traffic and conversions to your website.

**Potential outcomes:**

*  Paid advertising on social media may lead to high click-through rates and conversions, but may also be more expensive.

*  SEO may lead to slower but more sustainable growth, with lower costs over time.

*  Content marketing may lead to higher engagement and brand awareness, but may require more effort to produce high-quality content.

By experimenting with different marketing channels, you can identify which ones work best for your startup and optimize your marketing strategy accordingly. This can help you attract more potential customers, increase your conversion rates, and ultimately drive more revenue for your business.

# B. Priorities:

A high-priority experiment could be to test the hypothesis that potential customers would be interested in using LexiGenius as a cost-effective and efficient alternative to traditional legal document generation methods. This can be tested by conducting market research surveys or focus groups to gather feedback from potential customers on the idea of using an automated legal document generation software, their pain points with current methods, and their willingness to pay for such a service. The results of this experiment can provide valuable insights into the market demand and potential pricing strategy for the product.
