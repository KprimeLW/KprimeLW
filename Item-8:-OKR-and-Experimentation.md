## Experimentation

### **Experiment 1:** A/B tests different pricing models for our software.

**Hypothesis:** By testing different pricing models, we can optimize our pricing strategy to increase revenue and customer retention.

**Methodology:**

*  Identify at least two different pricing models that we would like to test. For example, we could test a per-document pricing model versus a 
   subscription pricing model.

*  Randomly assign a group of customers to each pricing model.

*  Measure the conversion rate, revenue per customer, and customer retention rate for each pricing model.

*  Analyze the results and determine which pricing model performs best.

**Potential outcomes:**

The subscription model may lead to higher customer retention rates and predictable revenue streams.

The per-document model may lead to higher revenue per customer but may be less predictable.

Depending on the results, we may decide to implement a hybrid pricing model that combines the best elements of each pricing model.

By experimenting with different pricing models, we can gain insights into what works best for our product and our target customers. This can help us optimize our pricing strategy and ultimately increase our revenue and customer retention rates.

   platforms, search engine optimization (SEO), and content marketing.

*  Measure the amount of traffic and conversions generated by each campaign.

*  Analyze the results and determine which marketing channels are most effective in driving traffic and conversions to your website.
