Upon undergoing such an experience, it became apparent to them that there is a substantial void within the market for a service that streamlines the process of composing legal documents while also rendering it approachable to those individuals and small businesses who lack the sufficient means required in hiring legal experts with exorbitant fees. The startup’s own experience serves as a guiding force for the mission and values of LexiGenius. The central objective of LexiGenius is to construct a specialized offering that centers on enabling both individuals and small-scale enterprises with the ability to manage their legal necessities.
